# Data Structures and Algorythms

Just a place to commit my DSA exercises and studies. Feel free to check them out.

## Neetcode

I'm following [Neetcode's Rodmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and solving them using Python.

Every exercise has at least one solution and a set of test cases to verify it's correctness.

To run the solution to, for example, the contains_duplicate problem, first `cd neetcode/Python` and then just run the command:

`python3 -m arrays_and_hashing.contains_duplicate`
